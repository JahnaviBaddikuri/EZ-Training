* ## Prime problem: In the enchanted land of Numeria, Alice is on a quest to find the legendary 
  Prime Key to unlock the ancient Vault of Secrets. The vault's guardian, an 
  ancient sphinx, presents a multi-step puzzle that Alice must solve to obtain the 
  Prime Key.<br>
  The puzzle consists of multiple levels, each requiring Alice to solve a different 
  challenge involving prime numbers. To progress through each level, Alice must 
  perform the following tasks:<br> 
  __Level 1__: Find the smallest prime number larger than a given integer N.<br>
  __Level 2__: Calculate the sum of all prime numbers between N and the smallest 
  prime number larger than  N.<br>
  __Level 3__: Determine if the product of the smallest prime number larger than N 
  and the next immediate prime number is also a prime.<br> 
  To complete the puzzle and retrieve the Prime Key, Alice must solve these 
  challenges in sequence for a given integer N.<br>
  Your task is to write a function that takes an integer N and returns a tuple 
  containing the following:
  - The smallest prime number larger than N _(Level 1 result)_.
  - The sum of all prime numbers between N and the smallest prime number 
  larger than N _(Level 2 result)_.
  - A boolean indicating whether the product of the smallest prime number 
  larger than N and the next immediate prime number is prime _(Level 3 result)_. 
  Help Alice navigate through the levels, solve the puzzle, and obtain the Prime 
  Key to unlock the Vault of Secrets.
